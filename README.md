using RF 434 MHz (Radio Frequency) transmitter and receiver modules, paired with STM32 microcontrollers, to establish a reliable and low-power one-way communication system. 
 The STM32 microcontrollers will control the transmission and reception of data, ensuring efficient performance in environments where traditional wireless systems fail.
